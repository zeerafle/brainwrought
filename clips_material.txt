What is CLIPS?
••CLIPS is a multiparadigm programming
language that provides support for:
– Rule-based
– Object-oriented
– Procedural programming
Syntactically, CLIPS resembles:
– Eclipse
– CLIPS/R2
– JESS
5
Other CLIPS Characteristics
•••CLIPS supports only forward-chaining rules.
The OOP capabilities of CLIPS are referred to as
CLIPS Object-Oriented Language (COOL).
The procedural language capabilities of CLIPS
are similar to languages such as:
– C
– Ada
– Pascal
– Lisp

•••CLIPS Characteristics
CLIPS is an acronym for C Language Integrated
Production System.
CLIPS was designed using the C language at the
NASA/Johnson Space Center.
CLIPS is portable – PC Æ CRAY.

CLIPS Notation
•••Symbols other than those delimited by < >, [ ], or
{ } should be typed exactly as shown.
[ ] mean the contents are optional and < > mean
that a replacement is to be made.
* following a description means that the
description can be replaced by zero or more
occurrences of the specified value.
8
CLIPS Notation
•Descriptions followed by + mean that one or
more values specified by description should be
used in place of the syntax description.
•A vertical bar | indicates a choice among one or
more of the items separated by the bars.
9
Fields
•To build a knowledge base, CLIPS must read
input from keyboard / files to execute commands
and load programs.
••During the execution process, CLIPS groups
symbols together into tokens – groups of
characters that have the same meaning.
A field is a special type of token of which there
are 8 types.
10
•••Numeric Fields
The floats and integers make up the numeric
fields – simply numbers.
Integers have only a sign and digits.
Floats have a decimal and possibly “e” for
scientific notation.
11
Symbol Fields
••Symbols begin with printable ASCII characters
followed by zero or more characters, followed by
a delimiter.
CLIPS is case sensitive.
12
String Fields
•••Strings must begin and end with double quotation
marks.
Spaces w/in the string are significant.
The actual delimiter symbols can be included in a
string by preceding the character with a
backslash.
13
Address Fields
•External addresses represent the address of an
external data structure returned by a user-defined
function.
•Fact address fields are used to refer to a specific
fact.
•Instance Name / Address field – instances are
similar to facts addresses but refer to the instance
rather than a fact.
14
Entering / Exiting CLIPS
••••The CLIPS prompt is: CLIPS>
This is the type-level mode where commands can
be entered.
To exit CLIPS, one types: CLIPS> (exit) 
CLIPS will accept input from the user / evaluate
it / return an appropriate response:
CLIPS> (+ 3 4)  Æ value 7 would be returned.
15
Facts and CLIPS
•••To solve a problem, CLIPS must have data or
information with which to reason.
Each chunk of information is called a fact.
Facts consist of:
– Relation name (symbolic field)
– Zero or more slots w/associated values
16
Example Fact in CLIPS
17
Deftemplate
••Before facts can be constructed, CLIPS must be
informed of the list of valid slots for a given
relation name.
A deftemplate is used to describe groups of facts
sharing the same relation name and contain
common information.
